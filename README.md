This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the sales performance of **Cookies** across various countries in 2018 & 2019. The dataset includes information on units sold, revenue, costs, and profit. The primary goal is to perform analysis, and create visualizations using **Power BI** to extract insights into sales trends, profitability, and regional performance.

### 2. **Population Data**:

The population data was **directly imported into Power BI** from a publicly available dataset on **Wikipedia**. The population figures were then merged with the sales data.
- **`Country`**
- **`Population`**
